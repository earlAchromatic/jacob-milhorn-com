excerpt: I use 11ty for 90% of my web projects. the reason is, I run a web agency that caters to small business. Although I could just as quickly whip up an app like experience using vue, (in some cases maybe quicker) I tend to reach for 11ty because static sites are extremely snappy, great for seo and performance, and user experience and are easily interactive enough for business marketing websites.

#Creativity and the future of human creativity.

How creativitiy works.

I am really into mental models. My mental model of creativity is that creative output is linearly proportional to combinations of atomic ideas at your disposal.

That is to say, the bigger pool of smaller ideas you have at your disposal, the more combinations you can generate - new ideas are simply combinations of smaller, previously existing ideas - and the more you can filter through before getting to the good ones.

Creativity is a 3 part system -

1. understanding the current problem landscape,
2. using your imagination to envision solutions to that problem that satisfies requirements then
3. running all those ideas thorugh a personal filter (taste based on experience) to weed out the ones that are less good, or wont work for some other reason.

What you have left are the good ideas. repeat the process, and eventually you get to the best idea, the best possible solution to your problem. Javascript reduce-style algorithm.

Reduction algorithm.

I talk through all 3 in other places, but I want to focus on Number 2 here - imagining solutions to a given problem. This is where the combinatorial aspects of creative gneeration come into play.

This, I beelieve is the seed of all creativity.

the sub-algorithm is simple: rapidly combine (cross-pollinate) base concepts (or atomic ideas) in various ways to generate a landscape of possible solutions to a problem.

The practical execution of this is not as simple. The truth is though, its not some mystical thing - its a skill that takes practice.

The implication of this is really neat. Counter to some poeple's beliefs, Creativity isn't some well that runs dry - its an endless spring from which you can pull. This is because you can train your brain to perfrom this rapid cross combination of many unrelated ideas every time you need a solution to a porblem.

You can build this way of thinking into your subconsience.

IF you are a creativitiy nerd like me, you may have heard of the prhase divergent thinking. This referes to the ability to think slowly (daniel khaneman) and deliberately as opposed to our normal state of operation - which is very fast, assumption based thinking that gets us through our next meeting, thourgh our day, and ultimately through most of our life.

Getting out of that normal state of thinking takes some practice, and some intentionality. I think this skill, more than any other is what you learn by going to engineering school - you are faced with problems to solve that most people don't have any need to solve any other time.

Your brain is plastic.

A creative brain is plastic. The best brain is plastic.

I think of ideas, thoughts and impulses as water or liquid running thorugh thr breain (this is not a scientific ust an analaogy). Water forms grooves and channels
