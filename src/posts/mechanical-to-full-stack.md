excerpt: I use 11ty for 90% of my web projects. the reason is, I run a web agency that caters to small business. Although I could just as quickly whip up an app like experience using vue, (in some cases maybe quicker) I tend to reach for 11ty because static sites are extremely snappy, great for seo and performance, and user experience and are easily interactive enough for business marketing websites.

I graduated in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering.

The work is fun - designing complex machinery from scratch, dreaming up every detail down to the nuts and bolts, gears and springs.

It's not unheard of in for mech e's to transition over to the dark side... software... and after doing it myself, I see how much sense it can make.

I could talk about the 'why' behind my transition, but what I find much more interesting is the surprising amount of conceptual overlap between the fields. and it all comes down to design thinking. That's what I am goint to talk about in this post.

My strength was rapid 3d drawing. Working in aerospace research, I often had to make mockups and feasibility studies down a specific path just to see if an idea could be executed with no promise of it ever being used. So speed was important.

Over time I built a real intuition about how much time to sink into a given aspect of the design and which could remain 'shallow' until you had more information - more context.

It's possible not every mech E has these ssame insights and experiences. Not every mech e is actually a design engineer. Out of my graduating class, I only know of a small handful of people who end up taking on the gritty responsibility that comes with mechanical design.

CAD

organization of files and designing in context.

3D cad is the expressive part of the design work. It was what I found to be particularly fun - starting with a blank slate and some minimal deseign req's like:

make a fixture that can withstand pressures needed to bend military grade high hardness armor. Oh and you have to use only magnets.

just an example.

Then you run with that, doing rapid iteration cycles, manage huge amounts of data from dimensions, functionality of hundreds if not thousands of components, material properties, form and fit and toleranceing, geometry, modern manufacturing methods - if what you design cant be made than is it a good design? - and wrapping it all up in a bill of materials and mfg and assembly prints.

and, while you are managing all of this information, the requirements fluidly change week to week if not day to day, requiring you the designer to have systems in place that allow you to very efficiently change the minimum number of variables and have them propogate through the designs.

This is abstraction. And though you wouldn;t think of things like maintainability when you think of CAD designgs, but you might if you have ever tried to build a new feature into someone's poorly thought out model.

So abstraction applies to design across fields. so does maintainability.

3d models are typically split into 3 types: parts (atomic), assemblies (many parts in one file) and then drawings (documentation so that someone else can build the part or assembly).

Not only do you have to manage features inside of the part itself, but you have to manage collections of these parts in an assembly file. So you have to be very thoughtful about which components go where- and hwat those components are named - all very similar to how you have to organize information in a codebase.

Design Thinking

Rapid iteration is a constant. The faster you can close the lloop on workign with current information and reqs, build out a feature, communicate to the team get feedback and update the design, the faster you can get robust designs out the door and turned into real products that serve real purpose.

Creativity

Ability to explore a solution space and find the shortest path thorugh all possible solutions to the optimized ones. I am a real believer in pushing the boundaries of human creativity. One of my personal missions is to help build the tools that let us do jsut that.

Creativity is a core requirement of the designer. creativity is algorithmic combination of atomic ideas to form a solutions pace. A talented engineer or designer will have intuition from years of experience and be able to narrow down the solution psace based on requirements and what they know will work.

Balancing this intuition and allowing oneself to think laterally enough to bypass convention and get to the really good ideas is a super important skill that designers should foster. Mechanical engineering manifests that skill in physical models of the solution space - do these metal parts collide, do thse screws fit here, can we build this? in Software engineering, you have the same exact brain patterns to thank for innovation, but they manifest as functions, data models, implementation details, and the like.

If you are a mechanical designer, you already have the core skillsets required to be a software designer - ability to manage massive amounts of information, make sense of it, tell the story of the end product through design files, organization, and docuemtnation. Communicating the important ideas, sometimes complex concepts in ways that non-technical team members can grasp so that the team can all seamlessly contribute.

It can go the other way too! if you are a software engineer, youi should try your hand at 3d drwaign sometime. The parts of your brain responsible for solving geospatial problems is fun to flex and will no doubt get you thinking in lateral strokes about whatever subconscious problems you are trying to solve.
